## Previously Reported Issues Detected by CR-Fuzz

The following table summarizes devices for which CR-Fuzz discovered crashes
that correspond to previously reported vulnerabilities or public issues.
The correspondence is established based on similarities in externally observable symptoms,
triggering input characteristics, and testing setup conditions such as
device model, firmware lineage, communication protocol, and related factors.
