## Confirmed Issues Corresponding to Previously Reported issues

The following table summarizes devices for which CR-Fuzz discovered crashes
that strongly resemble previously reported vulnerabilities or public bug
reports. Since prior disclosures often omit low-level input structures or
exact exploit traces, the correspondence is established based on similarities
in triggering conditions, externally observable behaviors, and testing
environment characteristics (e.g., device model, firmware lineage, and
communication protocol).
