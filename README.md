# CR-Fuzz
CR-Fuzz is a feedback-driven fuzzing framework designed for robotic vehicles, drones, and IoT devices that communicate through structured binary protocols (e.g., MAVLink, DUML, BLE ATT). It automatically analyzes packet semantics (PSI), generates adaptive mutation strategies, and discovers new system behaviors or crashes in black-box environments.
